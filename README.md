# 66DaysofData
*Documenting my journey through Ken Jee's #66DaysofData (Round 2).*

> *<ins>A bit of a preamble</ins>: Since starting my data journey late last year, frankly, I did not do a great job of planning. I was so excited to jump in that I dove headfirst into Python, simply because it's what I was seeing the most of on YouTube and in the 66DaysofData discord server. Now that I've gotten a little bit over the kid-in-a-candy-store adrenaline rush, I've taken a step back and realized (with the help of a few role models and looking through a lot of job postings) that my time and effort would likely be much better invested in other (ostensibly less "sexy") things right now. While I am so happy with all the things I've gained exposure to until now, I've decided to focus on getting comfortable with SQL, building a good stats foundation - and just understanding this whole ecosystem!*

### Day 1 (01/06/2021): SQL fun
Having already completed most of the SQL questions on hackerrank, I've branched out to both LeetCode and Codewars for my daily SQL querying practice. Of the handful of problems I solved today, [my favourite today](https://www.codewars.com/kata/581fb63e70ca28d92500000d) involved improving the performance of a working query. I *know* my queries are hacky and inefficient so it was a good change of pace to think about making queries more scalable. Starting tomorrow, I also plan on checking out [Learning SQL](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-sql-3rd/9781492057604/) and [The Art of SQL](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-art-of/0596008945/) to hopefully build a better theoretical understanding of databases and a more structured approach to querying.
